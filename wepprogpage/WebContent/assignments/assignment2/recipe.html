			<strong>Introduction to Recipe Rating System Chart</strong><br /> <br />
			In order to better help you identify recipes that feature a high
			concentration of nutrients for the calories they contain, we created
			a Recipe Rating System. This system allows us to highlight the
			recipes that are especially rich in particular nutrients. The
			following chart shows the nutrients for which 15-Minute Greek
			Garbanzo Bean Salad is either an excellent, very good, or good source
			(below the chart you will find a table that explains these
			qualifications). If a nutrient is not listed in the chart, it does
			not necessarily mean that the recipe doesn't contain it. It simply
			means that the nutrient is not provided in a sufficient amount or
			concentration to meet our rating criteria. (To view this recipe's
			in-depth nutritional profile that includes values for dozens of
			nutrients - not just the ones rated as excellent, very good, or good
			- please use the link below the chart.) To read this chart
			accurately, you'll need to glance back up to see the ingredients used
			in the recipe and the number of serving sizes provided by the recipe.
			Our nutrient ratings are based on a single serving. For example, if a
			recipe makes 4 servings, you would be receiving the nutrient amounts
			listed in the chart by eating 1/4th of the combined ingredients found
			in the recipe. Now, returning to the chart itself, you can look next
			to the nutrient name in order to find the nutrient amount it offers,
			the percent Daily Value (DV%) that this amount represents, the
			nutrient density that we calculated for this recipe and nutrient, and
			the rating we established in our rating system. For most of our
			nutrient ratings, we adopted the government standards for food
			labeling that are found in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's
			"Reference Values for Nutrition Labeling." <a
